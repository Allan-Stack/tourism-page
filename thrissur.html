        The name Thrissur (Malayalam: തൃശ്ശൂര്‍) is a shortened form Tamil / Malayalam word Thiru-Shiva-Per-Ur 
        (Malayalam: തിരു-ശിവ-പേര്-ഊര്, Lord-Shiva-Name-Town) literally translates to 
        'A Big City or Town with the three places of worship of the "Lord Shiva"'. 
        The name owes itself to the most prominent feature of the city, that is the Vadakkumnathan Temple,
         which has Shiva as its presiding deity. Alternately, Thri-Shiva-Perur (Malayalam: ത്രി-ശിവ-പേരൂർ, 
         Three-Shiva-Palace) means the place with three Shiva temples which are said to be 
         – the Vadakkumnathan Temple, Kottapuram Shiva temple and the Poonkunnam Siva Temple. 
         Thrissur was known by its anglicised name Trichur until 1990, when the government decided to replace 
         it with its Malayalam name.
         Thrissur was also known as "Vrishabhadripuram" (Kailasam of the South) in ancient days
