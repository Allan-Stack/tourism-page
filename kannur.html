        Kannur is one of the 14 districts along the west coast in the state of Kerala, India. 
        The town of Kannur is the district headquarters and gives the district its name. 
        The old name, Cannanore is the anglicised form of the Malayalam name "Kannur".

        Kannur was an important trading center in the 12th century with active business connections with Persia and Arabia.
         It served as the British military headquarters on India's west coast until 1887. 
         In conjunction with her sister city, Tellicherry, it was the third largest city on the western 
         coast of British India in the 18th century after Bombay and Karachi. St.
          Angelo Fort was built in 1505 by Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India.
          The Dutch captured the fort from the Portuguese in 1663.
           They modernised the fort and built the bastions Hollandia, Zeelandia and Frieslandia 
           that are the major features of the present structure.
         The original Portuguese fort was pulled down later
