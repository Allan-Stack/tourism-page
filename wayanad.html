        Wayanad district is the 12th District in the state of Kerala in India. Mananthavady, Sulthanbathery, 
        and Vythiri Taluks are all in Wayanad. The name Wayanad comes from Vayal Nadu and 
        it means the land of paddy fields. It is a high, flat land between 700 meters and 
        2100 meters above sea level. It is in northeaster Kerala, in the Western Ghat mountains.

        In ancient times the Vedar Rajas ruled Wayanad. Later the Pazhassi Raja of the Kottayam Royal Dynasty ruled. 
        Then there was a Mysorean invasion. Later, the British took over India, which lasted for 200 years. 
        The British fought the Pazhassi Rajah. When the state of Kerala started in 1956,
         Wayanad was part of the Cannannore district. In 1957, south Wayanad was 
         added to Kozhikode district and north Wayanad stayed with Cannannore district. 
         Today's Wayanad was made by putting north Wayanad and south Wayanad together. 
         This happened on November 1, 1980.
