    <h2>KASARAGOD</h2>

    <p> Kasaragod was known to the Arabs by the name Harkwillia.
         Many Arab travelers who visited Kerala between the 9th and the 14th centuries visited Kasaragod, 
         which was an important trade centre then. Duarte Borbosa, the Portuguese traveler who visited Kumbla,
          near Kasaragod in 1514, recorded rice being exported for coir to Maldives.[3]

        Kasaragod was part of the kumbala Kingdom in which there were 64 Malayalam and Tulu villages.
         When the Vijayanagara empire attacked Kasaragod, it was still under the Kolathiri Raja who had Nileshwaram
          as one of his capitals. During the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, the administration of this area was vested with Ikkeri Nayakas.
        At the onset of collapse of the Vijayanagara empire, Venkappa Nayaka declared independence to Ikkery.
         Kumbla, Chandragiri and Bekal are considered to be the chain of forts constructed or renovated by Shivappa
          Nayaka.
