    <p>  Ernakulam  refers to the central, mainland portion of the city of Kochi in central Kerala,
        India and has lent its name to the Ernakulam district. The Kerala High Court, 
        the office of the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the Cochin Stock Exchange are situated here. 
        The Ernakulam Junction is a major railway station of the Indian Railways. Initially, 
        Ernakulam was the headquarters of the Ernakulam District but was later shifted to Kakkanad. 
        Ernakulam was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin. 
        It is located 220 kilometres (137 mi) north-west of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. 
        The city has served as an incubator for many Malayali entrepreneurs and is a major financial and commercial hub of Kerala.

    <p> The state government and the GCDA have plans to include Angamaly, 
        Perumbavoor, Piravom and Kolenchery in the Ernakulam district;
        Mala and Kodungallur in the Thrissur district; Thalayolaparambu and Vaikom in Kottayam; 
        and Cherthala in the Alappuzha district within the Kochi metropolitan limits. 
        The newly formed metropolis would be put under the charge of a new authority called Kochi Metropolitan Regional Development Authority.
